## 🚀 About the project

This project is a submission for coursework assessment of the DevOps module SET09803 at Napier university
in this assessment we are building a new system that easy access to the population information extracted from
an existing world database available [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html).

The requirements for this project can be found
[here](https://github.com/Kevin-Sim/SET09803-DevOps-Global-Online/blob/master/assessment/README.md).

## 🐞 IntelliJ Debugger Setup

### Add a Remote JVM Debug Configuration

1. Go to **Run → Edit Configurations…**
2. Click **+** → Select **Remote JVM Debug** (sometimes *Remote Debug*).
3. Fill in:
    - **Name:** `Remote Debug App`
    - **Host:** `localhost`
    - **Port:** `5005`
    - Leave the rest as default.
4. Click **Apply → OK**.

### Debug Workflow

- **Step 1:** Run your **Docker-Compose Deployment** config → containers start.
- **Step 2:** Start your **Remote Debug App** config (Debug mode) → IntelliJ attaches to the JVM inside your container.
- **Step 3:** Run the app → breakpoints in IntelliJ should trigger.

### Helper Scripts

We need to always have a test DB up for the tests to work and to package the code for that reason we have created helper
scripts that can be found in /helper-scripts/ folder :

- **Run All tests:** by running  **run_tests.sh** it runs all tests, the script will deploy the test DB run the tests
  and then destroy the test DB.
- **Package the code:** by running  **build_package_clean.sh** it sets up the test DB run all tests, packages the code
  then destroys the test DB.
- **Start the test DB:** by running  **start_test_database.sh** it will deploy and start the test DB and keep it
  running.
- **stop the test DB:** by running  **stop_test_database.sh** it will stop and destroy the test DB docker container.
- **Docker clean up:** by running  **docker_cleanup.sh** it will stop and delete containers as well as the images.
- **Start and deploy a fresh application:** by running  **build_deploy_fresh.sh** it will run tests and package a new
  jar, clean up and docker images and stop containers associated to the application, then deploys a new application with
  docker compose.
