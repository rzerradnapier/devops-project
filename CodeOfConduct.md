# Code of Conduct – DevOps Coursework Project (Group 3)

## Purpose
This Code of Conduct sets expectations for respectful, collaborative behaviour in all our group interactions to facilitate a successful DevOps project.

## Standards of Behaviour
All team members agree to:
- Communicate respectfully and professionally in GitHub, Zube.io, Microsoft Teams, and email.
- Keep discussions on the Microsoft Teams group channel professional and relevant to the DevOps project. Avoid offensive jokes, political arguments, or inappropriate content.
- Follow agreed workflows (GitFlow branches, CI/CD pipelines, Docker usage).
- **Use Git Flow branches correctly:**
    - **master** – main branch for stable releases.
    - **develop** – integration branch for merging completed features.
    - **feature/** – create for each new feature, merge into develop when done.
    - **release/** – prepare a collection of features for release, comes from develop.
    - **hotfix/** – maintenance branches from master to fix production issues.
- Share updates as agreed daily by stating your commitment, what you’ve done, and if you have any blockers in the Microsoft Teams channel.
- Provide and accept constructive feedback on code, reviews, and documentation.
- Keep sensitive information secure by maintaining confidentiality of our team’s strategy, project progress, and code base. Team members must not share these details with other groups.

## Code Reviews
- All pull requests must be reviewed by **at least three team members** before merging into the develop or main branches.
- For small or urgent changes, a minimum of **two approvals** may be acceptable if agreed by the Scrum Master.
- This ensures higher code quality, shared knowledge of changes, and reduces the risk of bugs reaching production.

## Unacceptable Behaviour
The following will not be tolerated:
- Harassment, discrimination, or offensive comments in any form.
- Ignoring agreed workflows or breaking builds/deployments without notice.
- Sharing confidential credentials or security information irresponsibly.
- Non-collaborative behaviour (ghosting, spamming, or derailing discussions).
- Ignoring a failed pipeline or deployment for more than 24 hours without raising a blocker or escalating it to the team.
