# Code of Conduct – DevOps Coursework Project (Group 3)

## Purpose
This Code of Conduct sets expectations for respectful, collaborative behaviour in all our group interactions to facilitate a successful DevOps project.

## Standards of Behaviour
All team members agree to:
- Communicate respectfully and professionally in GitHub, Zube.io, Microsoft Teams, and email.
- Keep discussions on the Microsoft Teams group channel professional and relevant to the DevOps project. Avoid offensive jokes, political arguments, or inappropriate content.
- Follow agreed workflows (GitFlow branches, CI/CD pipelines, Docker usage).
- **Use Git Flow branches correctly:**
    - **master** – main branch for stable releases.
    - **develop** – integration branch for merging completed features.
    - **feature/** – create for each new feature, merge into develop when done.
    - **release/** – prepare a collection of features for release, comes from develop.
- Share updates by clearly stating your commitment, what you’ve completed, and if you have any blockers in the Microsoft Teams channel, as frequently as possible.
- Provide and accept constructive feedback on code, reviews, and documentation.
- Keep sensitive information secure by maintaining confidentiality of our team’s strategy, project progress, and code base. Team members must not share these details with other groups.

## Code Reviews
- All pull requests must be reviewed by **at least three team members** before merging into the develop or main branches.
- For small or urgent changes, a minimum of **two approvals** may be acceptable if agreed by the Scrum Master.
- This ensures higher code quality, shared knowledge of changes, and reduces the risk of bugs reaching production.

## Unacceptable Behaviour
The following will not be tolerated:
- Harassment, discrimination, or offensive comments in any form.
- Ignoring agreed workflows or breaking builds/deployments without notice or raising a blocker or escalating it to the team.
- Sharing confidential credentials or security information irresponsibly.
- Non-collaborative behaviour (ghosting, spamming, or derailing discussions).

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all team interactions and tools for this project, including:
- GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, and actions
- Zube.io boards
- Online meetings on Microsoft Teams
- Team emails and any other agreed communication channels

## Reporting
If you witness or experience a breach of this Code of Conduct, please contact the **Scrum Master** or inform the group privately. Concerns will be discussed and resolved fairly within the team. If the issue cannot be sorted internally, it may be escalated to the **Module Leader** for an impartial review.

## Agreement
This Code of Conduct has been read and agreed to by all team members of the DevOps coursework project on 28th September 2025.
By participating in the project, each member commits to adhering to these standards.
